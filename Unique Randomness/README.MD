# Unique Randomness (Week 2) (P5.JS PROJECT LINK: https://editor.p5js.org/Delvin/sketches/5dT97qxHM) 

## Data Type: Cities and Temperatures

### Overview
This project explores the unique weather and temperature patterns of various cities, represented as **City A, B, C, D, E**. Using a dataset containing approximately **1,089 values**, this generative art piece visualizes the data in an engaging and visually appealing way.

### Concept
The art piece utilizes a **color-coordinated system** to represent temperature:
- **Red**: Indicates hot temperatures.
- **Blue**: Represents cold temperatures.
- **Intermediate colors**: Depict variations in temperature.

The artwork also incorporates unique movement and style, enhancing the overall display. Each city's temperature is represented as a **cube attached to a spinning line** at the center, adding a dynamic and generative aspect to the visualization.

### Inspiration
The idea originated while searching online for interesting weather data from different cities. With a vast number of cities and their diverse temperatures, the concept of transforming this data into a generative art piece felt both innovative and exciting.

### Implementation
The project was programmed using **p5.js**. The steps included:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Compiling temperature data from hundreds of cities into a CSV file.
2. **Data Formatting**: Each temperature value was formatted to align with the generative art process.
3. **Visualization**: Using the data, the temperatures were mapped to color and shape, forming spinning cubes attached to a central line. 

### Results
The generative art piece combines **dynamic movement, color variation, and style** to showcase the uniqueness of the dataset. The spinning cubes reflect the diversity of temperatures in a visually captivating way.

This project demonstrates how combining **data, generative art, and programming** can result in a creative and meaningful representation of real-world information.
